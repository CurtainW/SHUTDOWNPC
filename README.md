# SHUTDOWNPC
MY FIRST PROJECT TO BUILD AN EXECUTABLE FILE
This my first executable file.
The main reason I do this is I find if I don't write some code,maybe I can do nothing. 
In fact, maybe I have a lot of knowledge about it, but I cannt to build a program.
############################
This program has 2 functions.First,input like is 'Y-M-D H:m:s' to set a time to shutdown.Second, just input what you want minutes and click 
'fix time'. oh,no   if you don't wanna do is or just wanna change a time , you can click 'nooooo'
